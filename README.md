# Welcome to my GitHub repository where I will be showcasing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, git and GitHub

This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub. Throughout the project, I will ensure 
clean commits with appropriate messages that accurately reflect the changes made. Using GitHub CLI, I will create and push the repository from my local workspace to GitHub, ensuring proper version control throughout the development process.

My workflow will be managed using Git and GitHub CLI, making commits whenever I refactor, edit, or add a new section of HTML 
and when adding CSS styling. This will enable me to easily track and revert changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a 
clear, organized codebase.

Additionally, I will adhere to best practices for web development, including semantic HTML and responsive design principles. 
This will ensure that the project is accessible and functional across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. 

I am committed to delivering a high-quality, professional-grade project.
